# URL Shortner (MVC Visual Basic)

### Final Project for Course at American Sentinel University ###



This is a very basic but useful URL shortner that can be self hosted for anyone to use.


Plan on developing another version using C#, because for the final project requirement was for it to be in Visual Basic :)




## Very simple to use. ##




1. Enter in the URL you want to shorten.
2. It gives you your shorten URL and that is it!
